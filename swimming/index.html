  <div class="swimmingcontent"><h2>My Swimming Career</h2> I was on Park City Swimming for the begining of my swimming career. Then when my brother came more competetive we moved to Salt Lake City to join a faster and more competetive team, WFFM. This lead to me improving at a better pace than if I was on Park City Swimming. Along the way I have met lots of amazing swimmers and coaches from all of Utah Swimming!
